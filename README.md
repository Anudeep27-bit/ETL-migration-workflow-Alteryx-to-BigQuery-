# ETL-migration-workflow-Alteryx-to-BigQuery-

                                    ETL migration  workflow (Alteryx to BigQuery)


Current process: Data Lake or Data center >Alteryx(Data cleaning & filtering ) > G-sheets Out-put

New process: Data Lake or Data center >Big Query(Data cleaning & filtering ) > G-sheets Out-put > Looker 




Phase 1: Discovery and Planning**
Task 1: Analyze Current Alteryx Workflow 
Objective: Understand the current data pipeline in Alteryx, including data sources, filters, transformations, and output structure.


Steps:
  1. Document the Alteryx workflow step-by-step, identifying data sources, filters, and any calculations.
  2. Break down the workflow into SQL-friendly steps to replicate in BigQuery.
  3. Identify any challenges (e.g., custom scripts or advanced transformations) that might not have direct SQL equivalents.
Expected Outcome: A full documentation of the Alteryx workflow ready to be translated into BigQuery queries.

Task 2: Define BigQuery Structure 
Objective: Design the BigQuery dataset and table structure to accommodate the data from the data lake and the workflow processes.
Steps:
  1. Define tables and schema based on the existing data pipeline.
  2. Ensure data types and structures are compatible with the output expected in GSheets.
Expected Outcome: A clear schema and structure for BigQuery tables.

Phase 2: Implementation of Data Pipeline
Task 3: Set Up Data Pipeline from Data Lake to BigQuery
Objective: Automate the data extraction from the data lake and load it into BigQuery, bypassing Alteryx.
Steps:
  1. Set up Google Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Composer, or similar tools to create an automated ETL pipeline.
  2. Define the frequency of data refresh from the data lake to BigQuery.
  3. Test the pipeline to ensure data is being correctly loaded.
Expected Outcome: A functioning data pipeline that automatically loads data from the data lake into BigQuery.
  
Task 4: Replicate Alteryx Filtering & Transformation in BigQuery
Objective: Convert the filters, transformations, and aggregations applied in Alteryx into SQL queries in BigQuery.
Steps:
  1. Write SQL queries to replicate all filtering, data transformations, and aggregations.
  2. Test the queries to ensure the output matches what was previously done in Alteryx.
  3. Ensure the data reduction from 39 million rows to ~40,000 rows is replicated accurately.
Expected Outcome: SQL queries in BigQuery that perform all required transformations and filtering, producing the desired 40,000-row output.

Phase 3: Integration and Validation**
Task 5: Connect BigQuery Data to Google Sheets
Objective: Set up the BigQuery data output to flow into Google Sheets, similar to the Alteryx-to-GSheets connection.
-Step:
  1. Use the BigQuery data connector for Google Sheets to link the filtered BigQuery data to a GSheet.
  2. Apply necessary formulas in Google Sheets, ensuring that the output mirrors the Alteryx-to-GSheets flow.
Expected Outcome: Data flows from BigQuery into GSheets, and outputs match the current Alteryx-GSheet process.

Task 6: Validate Data and Outputs 
Objective: Ensure that the data processed in BigQuery and pushed into GSheets matches the outputs from the original Alteryx process.
Steps:
  1. Compare outputs from the current Alteryx workflow to the new BigQuery workflow.
  2. Validate the 40,000-row output and ensure all formulas in GSheets work correctly with the new data source.
  3. Check for discrepancies and fine-tune the process if needed.
Expected Outcome: Full validation that the BigQuery process produces the same (or improved) results as the previous Alteryx-GSheet flow.

Phase 4: Finalization and Deployment
Task 7: Optimize and Document Process 
Objective: Optimize BigQuery queries for performance and document the entire workflow for future use.
Steps:
  1. Optimize SQL queries for performance to ensure quick processing of large datasets.
  2. Document the new workflow, including data pipeline, SQL queries, and integration with GSheets.
  3. Provide training or handover to relevant team members.
Expected Outcome: Optimized queries and complete documentation for the new BigQuery workflow.
